Hey, I'm Muhammad 👋 I've developed this food ordering app with a focus on the underlying frontend features and backend architecture. The features add so far are:
- Cart
- Google OAuth Sign in
- Responsive design for mobile
- Dark theme
- Checkout

The frontend is developed using React/Next.js and the backend is developed using Node/Nest.js. Distributed architecture patterns are used for codebases, i.e. microfrontends and microservices.
